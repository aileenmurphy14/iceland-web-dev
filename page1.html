                <p>We packed a lot of sightseeing and traveling into one week. There are so many beautiful places to see in Iceland that are so unique. 
                    We spent the first three days in Reykjavík, and then traveled to the southern region of Iceland. I recommend renting a 4x4 vehicle as 
                    your method of traveling. With a car, we were able to travel at our own pace and see way more places than we would have been on a bus (the first 
                    time I went to Iceland I took a bus tour, and I really think renting a car was a much better experience). They drive on the right side of the road, 
                    and there is not too much traffic even in the city. I recommend a 4x4 vehicle because some roads you may want to go on are dirt roads (for example, one 
                    of the Airbnb's I stayed in was off of a rough road that only 4x4 vehicles could go on). You can find updated information on the condition of roads 
                    <a href="http://www.road.is/">here</a> on the official website for The Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration (IRCA).

                    The Golden Circle is an extremely popular travel route that can be done in one day by car. Þingvellir National Park, Geysir Geothermal Field, Gullfoss, 
                    and Kerið crater are the main stops. It is very easy to travel through the Golden Circle from Reykjavík.

                <img src = "park.jpg" alt = "Thingvellir National Park" style="width:100%"class = "scroll_pic">
                <p>Our first stop on the Golden Circle was Þingvellir National Park. It is famous for both its historical significance and unique geology. 
                    Iceland is the only place in the world where you can see the Mid-Atlantic rift valley above sea level.

                <p>The Geysir Hot Spring Area is a geothermal field that contains a highly active geysir, Strokkur. It spouts boiling water 100 feet into the air 
                    every few minutes. 
                </p>
                <h4 style="text-align: center">Gulfoss</h4>

                <p>Gullfoss is a very popular waterfall to visit in Iceland. There is a narrow path that brings you to the bottom and upper tier of this two-tiered waterfall. 
                    Make sure to bring your rainjacket here especially if you plan to go to the lower tier.

                <h3 style="text-align: center">Kerið</h3>
                <img src = "kerid.jpg" alt = "Kerid crater" style="width:100%"class = "scroll_pic">
                <p>Kerið is a volcanic crater lake surrounded by uniquely red volcanic rock. You can walk around the top of the crater, as well as descend to 
                    the bottom of the crater to the lake. As of 2019, there is an entrance fee of 400 ISK.
