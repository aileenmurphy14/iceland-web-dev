                When traveling in Iceland, you will probably spend most of your time outside. It's so beautiful, 
                how could you not? This is why it is important to bring good quality and comfortable clothing 
                and footwear that you would not mind walking around in all day. <br><br>
                I traveled to Iceland in the summer. The temperature certainly varied day-to-day, but 
                I would recommend bringing clothing that can be layered over each other. 
                I brought a few long- and short- sleeve shirts, sweatshirts, and a lightweight waterproof jacket
                for my trip, and did not feel too cold. You will most likely be doing a 
                lot of walking, so I definitely recommend bringing a comfortable pair of hiking shoes
                and an alternate pair of sneakers. <br><br>Icelandic tap water is extremely clean and pure. The locals
                 find it strange (and frustrating due to environmental impacts) that tourists buy plastic bottled water at 
                supermarkets, since their water is so clean. So I recommend bringing a reusable water bottle
                that you can just refill instead of having to go to a supermarket and buy bottled water. Just make sure that 
                the water runs for a second or two and that it is cold water coming out of the tap, or it may have a sulfuric smell.<br><br>
                If you plan on going in a hot spring (for example, the Blue Lagoon), make sure to bring a 
                bathing suit and flip flops. Depending where you are staying and what hot spring you 
                are going to, you may want to pack a towel as well. <br><br> During the summer, the sun barely sets 
                so you may want to consider packing a sleep mask just in case your lodging does not have 
                blackout curtains.
