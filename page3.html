        <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Amatic SC', cursive; font-size: 60px">Places to Eat in Reykjavík</h1>
        <p style = "font-family:Trebuchet MS; padding-left: 150px; padding-right: 150px"> We did not eat out often in Iceland, but when we did, it was delicious. Be warned, food in Iceland is expensive compared to 
            most places in America (most days we made our food in the kitchen in our Airbnb's). A good grocery store that we went to is Bónus 
            in Reykjavík, which apparently has comparatively good prices than other supermarkets. However, sometimes after a long day of 
            hiking and traveling, we just did not feel like cooking. We also wanted to try different foods that are signature to Iceland.
            Here are some of my favorite places we ate. <br><br>

            <img src = "fishandchips.jpg" alt = "Icelandic Fish and Chips" style="width:100%" >
            <p>One of the places we got dinner was a small restaurant called Icelandic Fish and Chips, right by
                the Harbor in Reykjavík. I got the fish of the day with crispy potatoes.

            <img src = "hotdog_both.jpg" alt = "Hot Dog" style="width:100%" class = "foodpic">
            <p>If you have ever researched places to eat in Reykjavík, you most likely have come across this hot dog 
                stand. It is popular to locals and tourists alike. If you choose to go, make sure to order "the works." 
                Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur is located downtown near the harbor.

            <img src = "bakery_both.jpg" alt = "Braud Bakery" style="width:100%" class = "foodpic">
            <p>This cinnamon roll from Brauð & Co. is hands down the best cinnamon roll I have had in my life. Brauð & Co. is a 
                small bakery with a large selection of bread and pastries, and have coffee as well. I also tried a croissant and it
                was delicious. For the bakery's hours and menu, <a href="https://braudogco.is/en/">click here.</a>

            <p>It might sound crazy to get ice cream in a place that is so cold, but you will not regret it. There are many 
                unique flavors at Valdís if you are feeling adventurous, but I just went with the classic strawberry which was very good.

            <img src = "sandholt_both.jpg" alt = "Sandholt" style="width:100%" class = "foodpic">
            <p>We came across Sandholt right after we got to Reykjavík. We did not eat since leaving New York the day before, so we were 
                very hungry. Our food from Sandholt hit the spot. I got the shakshouka, which was very tasty and filling, with a pot of tea. 
                We liked this place so much we came back the day we were leaving Iceland. They also have a bakery with a large selection 
                of breads, desserts, and sandwiches.

            <p>The day we came to Svarta Kaffið it was cold and rainy, and we just wanted a warm meal. It is a very small place that serves
                drinks and bread bowls. Svarta Kaffið has a very small menu- 
                just two different types of soup per day in a bread bowl. I got the vegetable soup and it was amazing.
